1437950034.43	7	2.0	Read about file descriptor duplication and copy-on-write behavior of the fork() command.
1438025542.97	10	1.5	Learned about pipes, which are bytestreams. A bytestream is a type of file where there is no lseeking possible. You can only read in blocks, then read in the next block, etc. Pipes are unidirectional. If you close the write end of a pipe, you write an EOF before you close it for the reader to read.
1438026334.98	10	0.3	You can write under PIPE_BUF characters to a pipe and it is guaranteed to be atomic (not sure how...so the processor knows not to preempt the process and all interrupts are blocked when an atomic process is running? How is that guaranteed? If you write more than PIPE_BUF characters, it is not guaranteed to be an atomic write.
1438026989.74	10	1.5	Learned about how to create pipes and how the two fds of a process are dup'd on a call to fork().
1438027835.03	10	2.0	Learned the reason for forked processes to delete their unused pipe fds: the kernel doesn't have pipes behave normally if you don't. If there is still an unused write fd when reading, no EOF cwill be printed when the real writer closes. THis is a problem.
1438028505.57	10	2.0	Learned how pipes can be used to synchronize processes. Read reads in the amount of bytes you tell it, and blocks until it has read that amount. Write blocks until there is room to write. Reading moves the lseek buffer forward (metaphorically), thusly "deleting" the data behind it that has already been read.
1438029156.2	10	1.2	Didn't learn a lot.
1438029879.11	10	1.5	Started learning about FIFOs and the magic that they can do. FIFOs are basically pipes, but they are actual files, not stored in memory somewhere. FIFOs can be used to do interesting things, which I"ll learn abou tin a second.
1438030570.86	10	3.0	FIFOs can be used for lots of stuff. The tee command branches its input to both stdout AND a FIFO. pThreads is the mname of threads in Linux. ALl threads share the same heap (place where pointers are allocated), same globals, etc.
1438031457.58	5	1.4	Learned about how threads work. Threads all share the heap and environmental and global variables. They each get their own stack in program memory. They all read from the same program text, and presumably have their own program counter. Threads have an advantage over child processes in that they are faster to create and easier to synchronize. I will not learn about that synchronization.
1438031827.4	5	1.0	I learned about how threads in a single process share lots of stuff, like process ID, file descriptors, etc. They have separate thread IDs, signal blocking masks, stacks, scheduling information.
1438035405.61	5	1.0	Speaking notes aloud.

1438039084.83	5	1.3	
1438039441.2	5	1.0	Learned about how threads are good since fast and easy, bad since smaller and kinda more dangerous.
1438110196.34	5	0.4	no
1438110646.19	5	1.0	
1438111198.87	5	0.3	Interrupted this time.
1438111536.06	5	1.0	I learned about how even the increment operator isn't necessarily atomic. In order to guarentee atomicity, use mutexes!
1438111915.73	5	1.0	Learned how mutexes work. If you try to lock a locked mutex, you start blocking (immediately leave the processor) and try again later. I think it's best to immediately lock and unlock the mutex when you are using a shared resource, so as to minimize the time you are blocking others on the processor.
1438112286.91	5	1.0	Learned how to make a mutex: just declare a variable of type pthread_mutex_t and a mutex will be statically allocated on the stack. Then use pthread_mutex_(un)lock to lock/unlock it.
1438112712.52	5	1.5	Learned about the alternatives to pthread_lock, trylock and timedlock. trylock is good because you can do other stuff instead of blocking, but it is bad because you can get starved pretty easily. timedlock is good, but good programs shouldn't have long lock times anyway, so timedlock shouldn't be necessary.
1438279744.4	5	1.0	Semaphores are like mutexes except can take on several values and can be used when there are multiple instances of some shared resource. They exist in the kernel, not userspace. Semaphores can be named or unnamed.
1438280079.52	5	1.3	Learned how to make semaphores (they are kind of like files) using sem_open.
1438280401.05	5	0.7	Learned about how to use semaphores a bit more.
1438280750.9	5	2.0	Learned how to use semaphores. Use sem_wait when you want to use a resource. When the function returns, you are free to use it. sem_wait will decrement the semaphore, or block if it is zero. sem_pos is used when you are done, to increment the semaphore. 
1438281081.37	5	2.0	Didn't really learn much. Read about how to get the value of a semaphore.
1438281463.03	5	0.3	Semaphores are different form mutexes in that mutexes have ownership: if a thread locks a mutex, somehow the locker of that mutex (its thread id) is stored in the mutex such that only that mutex can unlock it. This is not the case for semaphores. Therefore semaphores are uglier. Also, there is a thing called "async safety" that semaphores have. Not sure what that means.

1439259847.74	7	3.0	no
1440431152.13	5	3.0	Reinforced that a prior is a probability of an event occuring, and when you get new information, these probabilities slide based on the new information. How likely an event is to occur is influenced by this new information, so you must factor it in.
1440431549.72	5	3.0	Learned the term "brainware" - components of the brain. Cool word, since it is similar to hardware. "Intuitive explanation" = concept easily portable to brainware constructs. Quantities are easily visualized in spcacial parts of the brain.
1440440981.53	5	0.0	
1441840875.66	7	7.0	Learned about how libertarianism is more harmonious thann other political philosophies, like the Republican party (conglomerate of Christians, gun-lovers and libertarian-ish ppl) and Democrats (conglomerate of sprogress-loving SJWs, socialists and people who want to maximize human hapiness).
1441841362.01	7	8.0	Read about how theory isn't always good, and even if llaissez-faire economics works in theory, that may not be how it actually works irl.
1441845505.92	7	7.0	no
1443303639.64	5	1.0	
1443379387.67	7	3.0	Learned about proportionality of P,V and T for closed system and gained more intuition on what pressure actually is.
1443381146.9	7	3.0	Learned PV=nRT, kelvin scale defined in terms of triple point of water, and how the relationship is only experimentally true when P=0. Presumably there are more terms that need to be added to make it a true relation at higher pressures.
1443381930.99	7	2.0	Learned how to calculate pressure using force: just multiply gravity times mass to get gravitational force, and know that P/A is the upwards pressure force (pressure is exerted in all directions, unless there is a vacuum involved).
1443382543.45	7	4.0	Partial pressures are just pressures due to different species.
1443385850.38	7	3.0	Learned about how the Virial equation is a better equation of state and how partial pressure works.
1443386744.38	7	3.0	Learned about PVT surfaces. THey show relationships between phases of water.
1443388004.53	7	4.0	]
1443388515.16	7	4.0	Modified Ideal Gas Law.
1443389164.19	7	4.0	Learned how Maclaurin series work! I wish I had known that a year ago, they are cool...

1443910079.02	5	0.0	no
1443910419.6	5	0.0	Learned about the Maxwell construction and how dv/dP>0 is unstable. So VDW is not accurate in the LG region.
1443925607.57	5	5.0	Thales believes that everything is water and made of gods. Water since water has lots of phases, and gods since everything is made of immortal objects. Aristotle called him the First PHilosopher.
1443925982.05	5	7.0	Anaximander's argument was that, since everything that begins is started by something else, there must be something with no beginning that created everything else, since something cannot come from nothing.
1443926410.23	5	8.0	Anaximander explains how a primal boundless chaos gives rise to all the things around us by physical processes we see (things separating when spun). He is using things we see in real life to explain stuff, which makes him at least semi-empirical.
1443926819.41	5	6.0	Xenophanes, younger than Aximander and Thales, believes that the Gods/divine shouldn't be represented as Homer and Hesios represented them, as flawed yet powerful individuals. He believes the divine should be greater than that. So it seems like the greek gods weren't actually that popular or worshipped. Even back then, there was a desire for a strong, immortal, far-removed-from-humanity sort of Divine.

1444250006.83	5	0.0	dU = Q - W is just conservation of energy. It can be transformed into other stuff later.
1444250426.51	5	0.0	PV=nRT isn't always true? It seems like in a bomb calorimeter experiment it doesn't work that way...
1444255333.24	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the heat given off at constant temperature. When you want to know heat, you can use the dU = dQ + pdV + vdP definition. At constant pressure (eg in the body), dU = dQ - pdV, or dQ = dU + pdV. For convenience we define H = U + PV, so that dH = dH + PdV at constant pressure. Then we have another word for heat at constant pressure: enthalpy. Basically just remember that heat and enthalpy are the same thing in bodily systems.
1444262842.13	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the energy available to the system. dH = dU + PdV (at const pressure). This means that if combusting some sugar gives off 10 kJ (dU=-10e3J) and the expansion is by 1 m^3 at 1Pa, then dH = -10000J + 1J = -9999J. This means that 9999 joules are liberated for work by the act of sugar burning.
1444352043.58	5	0.0	Gibbs free energy measures statistical likelihood of a rxn happening. Gibbs can be calculated from standard gibbs, which is somehow calculated... mathematically? Not sure how the entropy term is solved for. Standard GFE is found for 1 molar substances, then an RTln(concentration) term fixes the value for any molarity. The total change for all involved molecules of gibbs free enrgy is the change in GFE for a particular rxn. The standard free energy is the free energy of a rxn of one molar substance. When the ---
1444589288.73	5	0.5	Learned how redox reacitons are similar to acid reactions. A molecule can give up an H+, or it can give up an e-, becoming a different molecule. In acid chemistry, there is a pKa that describes the equilibrium of this reaciton. NOt sure yet how it's done with redox reactions, but I'll find out!
1444590861.19	5	1.0	Volts, or the difference in coloumbic field between two points, is the difference in potential energy between two points. If a particle transitions from a high-voltage area to a low-voltage area, they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, depending on their charge. This is path-independent, since potential energy is s tate function that only cares about starting and ending state. AAlso learned about  E0. E0 is the energy given off when an electron reduces the oxidant into the reductant in a particular pairing. E0 is kind of the negative voltage difference between the reductant and oxidant.
1444591301.61	5	1.0	High E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a strong oxidizer and its reductant is a weak oxidizer. Conversely, low E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a weak oxidant, whereas the reductant is a strong oxidant. E0 is basically how good the oxidant is at being an oxidant.
1444591825.44	5	0.0	The above statement is wrong! High E0 implies that the rexn happens a lot. That means that the oxidant is good at oxidizing, so it does, turning into the reductant. If the reductant was good at reducing, then it would, and go back into the oxidant and the rxn wouldn't be forward-biased. A high E0 actually means that the oxidant is a good oxidizer and the reductant is a bad reducer, it doesn't want to give up the electron it has gained. A low E0 means that the rxn doesn't happen a lot, meaning the electron-poor form is bad at gaining electrons (oxidizing) and the electron-rich form is good at giving them up (reducing). High E0: good oxidizer bad reducer. Low E0: bad oxidizer good reducer. Pair a good reducer with a good oxidier and you have a very spontaneous process!
1444592306.17	5	1.0	NADH is a good reducer. It gives off two electrons and a proton (gives off -2 and +1, ie gains 1) becoming NAD+. It is used for a lot of biological stuff whenever the body needs to reduce something. Also the delta G for a rxn is proportional to Ebig - Esmall, the net energy given off in the rxn, times -nF, where n is the # of electrons given off and F is a constant proportional to energy per mol per volt).
1444593171.77	5	0.0	E0 can also be thought of as the "negative voltage of the spot where teh electron goes in a rxn. A free electron has 0 PE, and when it encounters O2, it gains 8.15 J/mol/C in KE. It also takes 8.15 J/m/c to remove the electron from the reduced form.
1444593644.35	5	1.0	ethanol is spontaneously converted to acetaldehyde, 2H and 2e- in the cell, since its E0 is negative.
1444594134.37	5	0.0	none
1444594468.89	5	0.0	For some reason you use the gas pressure relative to normal gas pressure, not the absolute gas molarity, to determine the concentration for use in Henderson-Hasselbach type calculatesion.
1444595104.35	5	1.0	You never multiply E0 by anything. E0 is just the energy per erelectron. It's not like you're going to have double the energy per electron if you use twice as much NADH to reduce O2 into H20.
1444606109.11	5	4.0	Just reviewing basic physics of forces, work, etc.
1444606687.26	5	7.0	Still not much!
1444607250.85	5	3.0	Work is path-dependent, yyou can pressurize and work against lots of pressure, or work against low pressure then pressurize, and reach the same state of pressurized higher volume but different work. 
1444607570.08	5	3.0	Adiabatic systems are those that are heat-isolated, not constant temperature.
1445110292.66	5	0.0	DNA discovered by Frederich Miecher in 1870, surgical dressings. DNA is RNA with an H instead of an OH on its 2' carbon. 5' goes to the O of a Phosphate, 3' goes to the O of a phosphate, 1' goes to base. Bases either double bond or triple bond (H bonds) to other bases.
1445119138.71	5	0.0	DNA primary structure: ATGCTGAAA. DNA secondary structure: the way a single helix is formed. The bond lengths of the complementary bases in a helix. Tertiary Structure: the way different helices interact. Not sure if secondary or tertiary: supercoiling and the structures this creates. Probably secondary structure?
1445124321.75	5	1.0	Learned that the hydrolysis of polynucleotides is favored, but incredibly slow kinetically. This makes it "metastable."
1445125608.65	5	1.0	To make a DNA polymer you start with a nucleoside triphosphate. You add it to a polymer. The 3' OH on the polymer attacks the triphosphate and a diphosphate leaves. The diphosphate is a much better leaving group than an OH, which is why attack on a triphosphate is favorable when attack on a monophosphate is not favorable.
1445127141.94	5	0.0	Diphosphate is easier to remove from a Pi than OH, and so that is why ATP must be added to a polynucleotide, not AMP.
1445127903.51	5	1.0	Pyramidines pair with purines...Adenine and Guanine are purines, thymine and cytosine are pyramidines. AT and GC bond.
1445129018.56	5	1.0	Conservative: DNA is conserved, initial and final template is the same. Semi-conserved: part of the final template is the same as the initial template. Noncoblah Dispersive: new template has atoms of old template, not in order though.
1445131897.16	5	0.0	A form: RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA, low-humidity DNA-DNA. B form: DNA-DNA high humidity, ie, cellular conditions. A form more tightly packed, 11 residues per turn. B form less tightly packed, 10 per turn.
1445132322.94	5	0.0	B-DNA is more stable than A at high humidity, but A more stable at low humidity. B stabilized by water in its minor groove (?) at high humidity.
1445133208.81	5	0.0	Supercoiling: negative left-hand. supercoiling is tertiary structure of polynucleotide. Relaxed molecules float around and have longness. Super/supracoiled stuff doesn't do this.
1445139805.43	5	3.0	Polynucleotides rich in CG bonds have a higher dH for denaturing, since CG bonds are stronger. A molecule with all AT bonds would be much easier to break than one with all CG bonds.
