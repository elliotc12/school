1437950034.43	7	2.0	Read about file descriptor duplication and copy-on-write behavior of the fork() command.
1438025542.97	10	1.5	Learned about pipes, which are bytestreams. A bytestream is a type of file where there is no lseeking possible. You can only read in blocks, then read in the next block, etc. Pipes are unidirectional. If you close the write end of a pipe, you write an EOF before you close it for the reader to read.
1438026334.98	10	0.3	You can write under PIPE_BUF characters to a pipe and it is guaranteed to be atomic (not sure how...so the processor knows not to preempt the process and all interrupts are blocked when an atomic process is running? How is that guaranteed? If you write more than PIPE_BUF characters, it is not guaranteed to be an atomic write.
1438026989.74	10	1.5	Learned about how to create pipes and how the two fds of a process are dup'd on a call to fork().
1438027835.03	10	2.0	Learned the reason for forked processes to delete their unused pipe fds: the kernel doesn't have pipes behave normally if you don't. If there is still an unused write fd when reading, no EOF cwill be printed when the real writer closes. THis is a problem.
1438028505.57	10	2.0	Learned how pipes can be used to synchronize processes. Read reads in the amount of bytes you tell it, and blocks until it has read that amount. Write blocks until there is room to write. Reading moves the lseek buffer forward (metaphorically), thusly "deleting" the data behind it that has already been read.
1438029156.2	10	1.2	Didn't learn a lot.
1438029879.11	10	1.5	Started learning about FIFOs and the magic that they can do. FIFOs are basically pipes, but they are actual files, not stored in memory somewhere. FIFOs can be used to do interesting things, which I"ll learn abou tin a second.
1438030570.86	10	3.0	FIFOs can be used for lots of stuff. The tee command branches its input to both stdout AND a FIFO. pThreads is the mname of threads in Linux. ALl threads share the same heap (place where pointers are allocated), same globals, etc.
1438031457.58	5	1.4	Learned about how threads work. Threads all share the heap and environmental and global variables. They each get their own stack in program memory. They all read from the same program text, and presumably have their own program counter. Threads have an advantage over child processes in that they are faster to create and easier to synchronize. I will not learn about that synchronization.
1438031827.4	5	1.0	I learned about how threads in a single process share lots of stuff, like process ID, file descriptors, etc. They have separate thread IDs, signal blocking masks, stacks, scheduling information.

1438111198.87	5	0.3	Interrupted this time.
1438111536.06	5	1.0	I learned about how even the increment operator isn't necessarily atomic. In order to guarentee atomicity, use mutexes!
1438111915.73	5	1.0	Learned how mutexes work. If you try to lock a locked mutex, you start blocking (immediately leave the processor) and try again later. I think it's best to immediately lock and unlock the mutex when you are using a shared resource, so as to minimize the time you are blocking others on the processor.
1438112286.91	5	1.0	Learned how to make a mutex: just declare a variable of type pthread_mutex_t and a mutex will be statically allocated on the stack. Then use pthread_mutex_(un)lock to lock/unlock it.
1438112712.52	5	1.5	Learned about the alternatives to pthread_lock, trylock and timedlock. trylock is good because you can do other stuff instead of blocking, but it is bad because you can get starved pretty easily. timedlock is good, but good programs shouldn't have long lock times anyway, so timedlock shouldn't be necessary.
1438279744.4	5	1.0	Semaphores are like mutexes except can take on several values and can be used when there are multiple instances of some shared resource. They exist in the kernel, not userspace. Semaphores can be named or unnamed.
1438280079.52	5	1.3	Learned how to make semaphores (they are kind of like files) using sem_open.
1438280401.05	5	0.7	Learned about how to use semaphores a bit more.
1438280750.9	5	2.0	Learned how to use semaphores. Use sem_wait when you want to use a resource. When the function returns, you are free to use it. sem_wait will decrement the semaphore, or block if it is zero. sem_pos is used when you are done, to increment the semaphore. 
1438281081.37	5	2.0	Didn't really learn much. Read about how to get the value of a semaphore.
1438281463.03	5	0.3	Semaphores are different form mutexes in that mutexes have ownership: if a thread locks a mutex, somehow the locker of that mutex (its thread id) is stored in the mutex such that only that mutex can unlock it. This is not the case for semaphores. Therefore semaphores are uglier. Also, there is a thing called "async safety" that semaphores have. Not sure what that means.

1440431152.13	5	3.0	Reinforced that a prior is a probability of an event occuring, and when you get new information, these probabilities slide based on the new information. How likely an event is to occur is influenced by this new information, so you must factor it in.
1440431549.72	5	3.0	Learned the term "brainware" - components of the brain. Cool word, since it is similar to hardware. "Intuitive explanation" = concept easily portable to brainware constructs. Quantities are easily visualized in spcacial parts of the brain.
1440440981.53	5	0.0	
1441840875.66	7	7.0	Learned about how libertarianism is more harmonious thann other political philosophies, like the Republican party (conglomerate of Christians, gun-lovers and libertarian-ish ppl) and Democrats (conglomerate of sprogress-loving SJWs, socialists and people who want to maximize human hapiness).
1441841362.01	7	8.0	Read about how theory isn't always good, and even if llaissez-faire economics works in theory, that may not be how it actually works irl.

1443379387.67	7	3.0	Learned about proportionality of P,V and T for closed system and gained more intuition on what pressure actually is.
1443381146.9	7	3.0	Learned PV=nRT, kelvin scale defined in terms of triple point of water, and how the relationship is only experimentally true when P=0. Presumably there are more terms that need to be added to make it a true relation at higher pressures.
1443381930.99	7	2.0	Learned how to calculate pressure using force: just multiply gravity times mass to get gravitational force, and know that P/A is the upwards pressure force (pressure is exerted in all directions, unless there is a vacuum involved).
1443382543.45	7	4.0	Partial pressures are just pressures due to different species.
1443385850.38	7	3.0	Learned about how the Virial equation is a better equation of state and how partial pressure works.
1443386744.38	7	3.0	Learned about PVT surfaces. THey show relationships between phases of water.

1443388515.16	7	4.0	Modified Ideal Gas Law.
1443389164.19	7	4.0	Learned how Maclaurin series work! I wish I had known that a year ago, they are cool...

1443910419.6	5	0.0	Learned about the Maxwell construction and how dv/dP>0 is unstable. So VDW is not accurate in the LG region.
1443925607.57	5	5.0	Thales believes that everything is water and made of gods. Water since water has lots of phases, and gods since everything is made of immortal objects. Aristotle called him the First PHilosopher.
1443925982.05	5	7.0	Anaximander's argument was that, since everything that begins is started by something else, there must be something with no beginning that created everything else, since something cannot come from nothing.
1443926410.23	5	8.0	Anaximander explains how a primal boundless chaos gives rise to all the things around us by physical processes we see (things separating when spun). He is using things we see in real life to explain stuff, which makes him at least semi-empirical.
1443926819.41	5	6.0	Xenophanes, younger than Aximander and Thales, believes that the Gods/divine shouldn't be represented as Homer and Hesios represented them, as flawed yet powerful individuals. He believes the divine should be greater than that. So it seems like the greek gods weren't actually that popular or worshipped. Even back then, there was a desire for a strong, immortal, far-removed-from-humanity sort of Divine.

1444250006.83	5	0.0	dU = Q - W is just conservation of energy. It can be transformed into other stuff later.
1444250426.51	5	0.0	PV=nRT isn't always true? It seems like in a bomb calorimeter experiment it doesn't work that way...
1444255333.24	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the heat given off at constant temperature. When you want to know heat, you can use the dU = dQ + pdV + vdP definition. At constant pressure (eg in the body), dU = dQ - pdV, or dQ = dU + pdV. For convenience we define H = U + PV, so that dH = dH + PdV at constant pressure. Then we have another word for heat at constant pressure: enthalpy. Basically just remember that heat and enthalpy are the same thing in bodily systems.
1444262842.13	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the energy available to the system. dH = dU + PdV (at const pressure). This means that if combusting some sugar gives off 10 kJ (dU=-10e3J) and the expansion is by 1 m^3 at 1Pa, then dH = -10000J + 1J = -9999J. This means that 9999 joules are liberated for work by the act of sugar burning.
1444352043.58	5	0.0	Gibbs free energy measures statistical likelihood of a rxn happening. Gibbs can be calculated from standard gibbs, which is somehow calculated... mathematically? Not sure how the entropy term is solved for. Standard GFE is found for 1 molar substances, then an RTln(concentration) term fixes the value for any molarity. The total change for all involved molecules of gibbs free enrgy is the change in GFE for a particular rxn. The standard free energy is the free energy of a rxn of one molar substance. When the ---
1444589288.73	5	0.5	Learned how redox reacitons are similar to acid reactions. A molecule can give up an H+, or it can give up an e-, becoming a different molecule. In acid chemistry, there is a pKa that describes the equilibrium of this reaciton. NOt sure yet how it's done with redox reactions, but I'll find out!
1444590861.19	5	1.0	Volts, or the difference in coloumbic field between two points, is the difference in potential energy between two points. If a particle transitions from a high-voltage area to a low-voltage area, they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, depending on their charge. This is path-independent, since potential energy is s tate function that only cares about starting and ending state. AAlso learned about  E0. E0 is the energy given off when an electron reduces the oxidant into the reductant in a particular pairing. E0 is kind of the negative voltage difference between the reductant and oxidant.
1444591301.61	5	1.0	High E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a strong oxidizer and its reductant is a weak oxidizer. Conversely, low E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a weak oxidant, whereas the reductant is a strong oxidant. E0 is basically how good the oxidant is at being an oxidant.
1444591825.44	5	0.0	The above statement is wrong! High E0 implies that the rexn happens a lot. That means that the oxidant is good at oxidizing, so it does, turning into the reductant. If the reductant was good at reducing, then it would, and go back into the oxidant and the rxn wouldn't be forward-biased. A high E0 actually means that the oxidant is a good oxidizer and the reductant is a bad reducer, it doesn't want to give up the electron it has gained. A low E0 means that the rxn doesn't happen a lot, meaning the electron-poor form is bad at gaining electrons (oxidizing) and the electron-rich form is good at giving them up (reducing). High E0: good oxidizer bad reducer. Low E0: bad oxidizer good reducer. Pair a good reducer with a good oxidier and you have a very spontaneous process!
1444592306.17	5	1.0	NADH is a good reducer. It gives off two electrons and a proton (gives off -2 and +1, ie gains 1) becoming NAD+. It is used for a lot of biological stuff whenever the body needs to reduce something. Also the delta G for a rxn is proportional to Ebig - Esmall, the net energy given off in the rxn, times -nF, where n is the # of electrons given off and F is a constant proportional to energy per mol per volt).
1444593171.77	5	0.0	E0 can also be thought of as the "negative voltage of the spot where teh electron goes in a rxn. A free electron has 0 PE, and when it encounters O2, it gains 8.15 J/mol/C in KE. It also takes 8.15 J/m/c to remove the electron from the reduced form.
1444593644.35	5	1.0	ethanol is spontaneously converted to acetaldehyde, 2H and 2e- in the cell, since its E0 is negative.

1444594468.89	5	0.0	For some reason you use the gas pressure relative to normal gas pressure, not the absolute gas molarity, to determine the concentration for use in Henderson-Hasselbach type calculatesion.
1444595104.35	5	1.0	You never multiply E0 by anything. E0 is just the energy per erelectron. It's not like you're going to have double the energy per electron if you use twice as much NADH to reduce O2 into H20.
1444606109.11	5	4.0	Just reviewing basic physics of forces, work, etc.
1444606687.26	5	7.0	Still not much!
1444607250.85	5	3.0	Work is path-dependent, yyou can pressurize and work against lots of pressure, or work against low pressure then pressurize, and reach the same state of pressurized higher volume but different work. 
1444607570.08	5	3.0	Adiabatic systems are those that are heat-isolated, not constant temperature.

1446418644.81	5	0.0	Plato discusses mathematics as knowledge. He says that it is possible to completely grasp the "reason" why mathematics works, and therefore our knowledge of math is knowledge, not belief. The example given was you can "know" (not believe) that a square composed of the diagonal of an existing square in side length is double the area of the existing square. This proof can be seen, and the proof is simple enough to cosntitute a complete, undeniable reason. I disagree. The "reason" is not a reason. It seems like it could be true, but is it? It could be a false proof that just looks really true, but isn't always true in all cases, or something like that. Math is a theoretical set of axioms that can be interpreted by the mind. Operations can be done in the mind. But it is possible to create proofs that look right but aren't right, or rather, that don't agree with the other axioms. 
1446419551.89	5	0.0	Plato believes that if something really really makes sense, it is a "reason" which is somehow not just a concept in his mind but linked to universal truth. He believes that seeing a picture of a square with a small diagonal square inside it, and seeing that each piece of small square has a mirrored piece outside the small square but in the large square proves that the large square is exactly double the small square's area. He believes that this explanation of a conceptual thing is Truth. In reality, this is just semantics. It is using pattern matching to relate phrases together. The proof can be expressed verbally using symbols, and the mind can see if all the small phrases are true, and if they are all true, the chain must be true and the claim and the solution must have a chain of implication. But this isn't truth, this is just creating sentences that seem to agree. But they say fundamentally different things, and so can't have any meaning. Implication doesn't exist, there is nothing but sensory experience. Math isn't a special thing that exists outside of us, math that can be interpreted by human beings is a set of things that our brain creates that relate. There is no such thing as rationality ahhhhhh this is way too much and I have no means of evaluating what is right or wrong I am just generating sentences that don't make sense what is sense sense is patterns that seem to relate well you can never escape the brain's world everything you think or do is governed by the brain you must understand how the brain works in order to understand reality ahhhhh
1446421937.58	5	0.0	Math is trivially true. It is a logical framework, and so it can make statements and those statements can either agree or disagree with the rest of the framework. It is "true" in the sense that it is consistent, but can we really know? Can we really meaningfully interact with mathland and determine whether things are true? Our brains are physical objects rmine whether statements are true? No. Our brain is a physical object which takes stimuli and has neurons change states to produce an output. If a computer program could perfectly simulate the neural network of a human brain, with all the connections, the type of each connection, the way neurotransmitters influence the behavior if individual neurons, and how the neurons interact with other objects in the brain (glia), it would be possible to tell the computer about the square problem and it would change its state. You would then ask it whether this statement was true, it would change state some more and return the answer true to you. But do you really think that something magical happened in this system? The neural network changed state to bring the problem inside it, then did pattern matching, drew upon memories, displayed the problem different ways, then gradually increased the number of neurons innervating the "say yes" region, which then said yes to you. Nothing in this process tells us that Truth was acquired. We just saw a physical process occur, like a billiar ball crash into a big network of other billiard balls. We don't ascribe Truth or Knowledge to the physical process any more than we ascribe truth to billiard balls flying around. Physical processes cannot contain truth, since they are just atoms. These atoms can be moved around in a way tha--- takes the outside world and represents it internally, but this mapping is imperfect. And since the mapping is imperfect, the very best we could hope to get is how something happens in the internal mapping of the brain, but not how something happens in the external world. And this is a best case scenario. In reality, the internal conception of reality in a human brain is not simulated at all. A network of concepts is created and reacted to, but no simulation ofthe world occurs. If a human is asked to take a physical system that really occurs in the world, say a ball that is falling, and extrapolate what will happen next, the human will look at the ball. It will note that the problem is a ball is falling. It will have a picture of a ball, and it will draw on its memories of what it has experienced in the past in regards to falling balls: they fall. It will draw upon its physics knowledge, that a ball is moving with some velocity and that it will keep moving unless acted on by a force. It will draw upon its basic pattern-matching system, which tells it that this is a dumb question that is asked to many people and the answer is always "it falls". So the human will say the phrase "it will keep falling down" and that will be that. This claim has nothing to do with reality, it is a claim constructed from memories and observations. There is no reason to think it is right, even if all the information in the world was at the grips of this human. This human is just a system of interconnected neurons. Nowhere in the human is a falling ball, the falling ball is outside. There is no reason to think the human's brain will do the same thing the falling ball will, since the falling ball is outside, and the human is not the falling ball. We have two different systems. They are connected, but are fundamentally different. The human brain is just a collection of neurons, and by its nature, cannot be anything other than that: a collection of atoms. There is no Truth in the human brain, only atoms. 
1446423009.53	5	0.0	There is no machine which interacts with Truth in the brain, the brain takes in sensory information and runs basic processes on itself and comes to a conclusion that helps it stay alive. Pl--- The square which Plato is referring to isn't a real square in teh world. It isn't a Timeless Mathematical Object, either. It is a group of neurons which interpret words on a page, take the picture of a square with a square inside its diagonals, make the claim that because the inside of the square is exactly mirrored by the non-inside square the two must be equal, then innervate speech neurons to say so. This object doesn't exist, it is always bound in neurons and can be put in other brains by speech or writing, but it doesn't exist in the physical world. But it can be put in brains, and these brains can then use it to do physical work. So it is useful and good. Its a special pattern that happens to make good things. The pattern can exist in neural linkages, in electrons being pushed from one place to another, in teh form of sound vibrations or scribbles on a page. And it influences other brains. But it does not exist. It can never be truly evaluated, since that word has no real definition. It can only be interpreted by the brain and used to trigger statements that can be heard by others. Ideas exist in the brain and can be transmitted to others. They are represented by matter, and can interact with other ideas in the brain. But they can never reach the truth, since they will always be patterns in matter.

1445119138.71	5	0.0	DNA primary structure: ATGCTGAAA. DNA secondary structure: the way a single helix is formed. The bond lengths of the complementary bases in a helix. Tertiary Structure: the way different helices interact. Not sure if secondary or tertiary: supercoiling and the structures this creates. Probably secondary structure?
1445124321.75	5	1.0	Learned that the hydrolysis of polynucleotides is favored, but incredibly slow kinetically. This makes it "metastable."
1445125608.65	5	1.0	To make a DNA polymer you start with a nucleoside triphosphate. You add it to a polymer. The 3' OH on the polymer attacks the triphosphate and a diphosphate leaves. The diphosphate is a much better leaving group than an OH, which is why attack on a triphosphate is favorable when attack on a monophosphate is not favorable.
1445127141.94	5	0.0	Diphosphate is easier to remove from a Pi than OH, and so that is why ATP must be added to a polynucleotide, not AMP.

1445829969.71	6	0.0	You can predict where stuff'll cleave. R1 means it cleaves to the right, R2 means it cleaves to the left. Cysteine forms disulfide bonds with other cysteines, and so cannot react with certain things.
1445831039.11	6	3.0	Proline is a cyclic amino acid, and has an NH2 group. This means it's pretty stable and won't give up any Hs at 10 pH. probably. Also cysteine forms disulfide bonds when it gets oxidized. A good oxidizer like O2 would come in and take electrons from two SH groups, so they couldn't support their Hs. They would then bond together.

Also that an LMM (Euler's method, backwards Euler's method, Trapezoidal method, not sure about RUnge-kutta etc) is a method which relates positions with the derivative of those positions and times (NO squaring, fancy stuff involved).
1445968270.76	7	2.0	Learning how the Adam-Bashforth method works. Euler's works by relating the current derivative and position to finding the next point. AB works by relating the current AND next derivative AND next position to finding the next next position. Not really sure why the previous derivative has any information useful for finding the next next position.
1445969686.64	7	7.0	Stiff DEs: Those that are hard to numerically compute because they have very steep velocities and thusly can be hard to track. A spline is a piecewise polynomial fit to a certain function. Runge's phenomenon: The higher the order of a polynomial fit, the more inter-node error there will be. 
1445970204.59	7	2.0	Trapezoidal method is the highest-order error-term method, for some weird reason. NOt sure why. There are many LMM methods and they all take into account many different derivatives, but they are all just linear combinations of these different terms. I think RK and other methods are more sophisticated.
1445970781.24	7	3.0	Stiff DE: one that varies lots. Something about their matrix representation idicates that they are stiff. Convergence: Whether the approximate solution approaches the real solution as h->0. If the order (thhe order of h in the error term) in the order is greater than 0, then the solution is stable since the error goes to zero quicker (or as quicly as) the timestep.
1445988045.76	7	3.0	You can use polynomial interpolation (fitting to what?) to find the alpha/beta terms in the linear combination of position vs velocity fequality.

1446408490.17	5	1.0	Primary structure: order of amino acids. Secondary structure: base pairs coming together to form structures like alpha-helices or beta sheets. Tertiary structure: R-groups interacting to form larger structures.
1446409552.27	5	1.0	An alpha helix is a secondary structure where the N-C-O planes form a spiral such that the molecule helically coils. NCO is planar, and there is rotation around the Ca bonds to make the helix. This is a secondary structure since R-groups are not important. Only the peptide bases matter. The Beta sheet is another secondary structure where two peptide strands join together to form a sheet which is linked by CO---H hydrogen bonds. Presumably the R-groups interfere with the formation of these, since all bases are the same and it isn't clear why a protein would form an alpha helix in a particular place.
1446410315.56	5	1.0	Alpha helices can form where one side (there are four amino acids per turn? not sure...) is mostly hydrophobic side-chains (long carbon-chain ones like alanine valine glycine leucine isoleucine), this alpha helix can nestle up to other similar alpha helices. This is a tertiary structure.
1446410882.23	5	1.0	Alpha helices can have different values for repeat, pitch and rise. Residues per turn doesn't have to be integral.
1446411557.38	5	1.0	In every alpha helix, every fourth AA hydrogen bonds together. This means that AHs with residues/turn far from 4 are unstable.
1446412623.66	5	1.0	Ramachandran Plot: A plot which relates teh phi and psi angles possible for a particular amino acid residue. It shows how different types of secondary structure can be described perfectly by just the phi and psi values constant for all Ca carbons.
1446414329.28	5	1.0	What Ramachandran plots are for (showing what phi/psi values are allowed, showing how primary structure decides secondary structure) and what alpha helices beta strands/sheets 310 helices polypeptide II helices are.
1446414981.53	5	1.0	There are globular and fibrous proteins. Fibrous proteins are mostly for holding stuff together in the body and acting as surfaces. Silk, pig aorta, etc. These have lots of glycine, alanine, leucine, and other hydrophobic amino acids.
1446416478.06	5	1.0	Alpha-Keratin is a protein found in skin and is a major component of hair and nails. It is basically a very long alpha-helix which forms a coiled-coil with another alpha-keratin. These dimers link with other dimers to form long protofilaments and protofibrils. Alpha-helices have 3.6 residues per turn, or a non-integer number, so they have a winding strip of hydrophobicity. This strip can join with another monomer to form a stable coiled-coil. A coiled-coil should be a secondary structure?
1446416835.29	5	1.0	Fibroin is another fibrous protein which is in silk. It is beta sheets with specific amino acids which cause beta sheets to cling togehter via dispersion.
1446417274.79	5	1.0	Collagen is used for bone matrices (and tendons and ligaments?). It is a triple helix of tropocollagen with a particular AA sequence.
1446418319.46	5	1.0	Tropocollagen is first synthesized by ribosomes inside the rough ER. There its proline and lysines are hydroxylated. It also has sugars added to it. Then it is secreted from teh ER and forms a triple helix. It is then secreted from the cell. There its C and N-terminal globular domains are removed and its lysines are de-amined, so de-aminated lysines bond together to form cross-links.
1446419684.31	5	1.0	The CATH system is like a phylogenetic tree, but for proteins. And also not really, since it is not based on evolutionary relationship, but structure. But each superfamily should be monophyletic. Basically things are categorized into a Class, then an Architecture (a b a sandwitch), then a topology (aab vs aba vs baa) then a homologous superfamily.--- each superfamily is believed to have a common ancestor that all its members descended from.
1446420034.18	5	1.0	Tertiary folding rules: there is an inside and outside, b sheets are twisted, corners can be turned, and some AA sequences have random structure.
1446421793.1	5	1.0	Hydrophobic effect: The increase in a protein's unfolded-state entropy due to hydrophobic clathrates. The more hydrophobic amino acids are present (alanine valine leucine glycine) the higher the entropy of --- the LOWEr the entropy of the unfolded state. This means that the entropy change can actually be positive from going from unfolded to folded for proteins rich in hydrophobic zones.
1446422182.66	5	1.0	Salt bridges are where a negative and positive side chain group together. Hydrogen bonds between R groups and vanderwaals interactions also contribute to lowering the enthalpy of a folded molecule.
1446424412.3	5	2.0	You can add disulfide bonds to a protein to make it more stable. YOu're basically just decreasing the entropy of the unfolded state, and since dS = d_fold - d_unfold, this makes dS more positive and hence less likely to happen.
1446425654.9	5	2.0	Levinthal's Paradox: By going through a random sample of states, a protein could never fold. Therefore it must be energy-scaffolded so that transitioning to a more favored state limits the pool of possible state transitions repeatedly. Basically, to coutneract levinthal's paradox, the energy map of all the states must be a funnel, such that high energy states lead down the pathway to low-energy states. The states on the energy map near a state are the states the molecule can transition to. There is always a negative slope in energy between any state and the lowest-energy state. This is a smooth funnel. This can be contrasted with a completely random terrain, where Leveinthal's Paradox would cause the molecule to take forever to fold.
1446426011.68	5	1.0	Nucleation events: Events which hugely restrict the number of states for the protein to sample. Nucleating an alpha sheet is hard to undo, and once it occurs, the protein has taken a large step towards properly folding.
1446426394.35	5	1.0	Incorrect bond-rotation for proline (which can rotate its amide bond due to no pi electron group) slows down folding. Prolyl isomerase fixes this problem. Also incorrect disulfide bonds can slow folding. Protein disulfide isomerase fixes this somehow.
1446426970.09	5	1.0	Alpha-helix proteins fold faster than Beta-sheet proteins. Also, there is a huge correlation between contact order (how much a protein's residues interact with faraway residues) and how slow it folds. Basically, a highly contacting protein (globular) with lots of faraway bonds will take a loooong time to fold, since it has to randomly get faraway residues to interact, which is unlikely. It is easier if all the residues only need to contact their neighbors, like in a long alpha helix.
1446427637.88	5	1.0	Chaperones allow proper folding and dissuade aggregation by disallowing the formation of especially favorable off-path intermediates. They can also help proteins refold that have been damaged by heat.
1446428251.46	5	1.0	Chaperones can also allow mutated proteins to continue functioning by forcing them to fold the way they should, not the way they want to. Also Amyloid fibrils are structures where the primary structure of the protein forms beta-sheets with lots of other unwound forms of the protein. This is the most stable form for every protein. It is really bad and forms in cells. Chaperones specifically make sure structures like these DONT form.
1446428641.7	5	1.0	Prions are proteins which can take on alternate conformations. These alternate conformations act as enzymes to catalyze their own formation. They are simple self-replicating molecules. Prions are bad because they often also have negative effects on the cells they inhabit.
1446429034.14	5	1.0	Proteins vibrate, as do domains and atoms. These vibrations can have their period calculated with physics maybe?
1446429982.22	5	1.0	In order to find possible folded states given primary structure, you need a potential function to minimize. This potential function will give the energy of the system and be based on the hydrogen bonding, covalent interactions, dispersive forces, etc which contribute to the favorability of a particular conformation. Once calculated, you can brute-force to find the ideal If you have sequence homology information, you can bias your search towards conformations that look similar to conformations of proteins with similar primary structures.

1446438242.39	5	0.75	Socrates was a moral philosopher. A moral philosopher is somehow who believes in universal morality and wishes to understand it. Socrates believed there was a "right way to live" for any human and he spent his life trying to figure out what that way was through deductive reasoning. He believed that by discussing a topic and coming to a statement that had no flaws, one could create the truth. He believed that the truth was very accessible to humans, since he could reach it purely through dialogue. Plato was his student and buitl upon this. Socrates believed that morality was the most important thing. He believed that not hurting people/entities was good.

1446438989.73	5	0.5	Plato has socrates say that "Beliefs are beliefs, and knowledge is a belief that has been anchored down through rational reasoning."
1446439423.89	5	0.9	Plato is trying to lay out how beliefs are different from knowledge. It is only kind of working. He is saying that if you know the reason why something is true, and your reason is valid, you have knowledge. If you don't know the reason why, then it is a belief. So having a "reason why something is right" makes it knowlege. But what if this reason is merely a belief, or badly argued? You can be able to justify something, but what if your justification is wrong? Basically, your justification has to be knowledge if your belief is to be knowledge. SO this doesn't really answer the question.
1446504827.72	7	0.0	In an ideal gas, when temperature changes at constant pressure, enthalpy is just dQ + PdV = dQ. So entropy is dH_p/T, or CpdT/T. When temperature is constant, internal energy cannot change, and so PdV = dQ, so dS = P/T dV = nR/V dV = nrln(V1/V2) = nRln(P2/P1).
1446515048.31	7	0.0	Again, found that S = KbLn(W), where W is the microstates of a particular state. Also, DS = KbLn(Wf/Wi), and Wf/Wi is the probability of being in state f over state i. If it is 3x as likely to be in f than i, Wf/Wi is three. Also, when you mix two gasses together and they are ideal, the entropy change is just the entropy change of each gas initially to finally without interacting. Gasses 1 and 2 going from a small chamber to a big one changes entropy, since the gas is expanding its V, so it is possible that U would change. Si--- There is work being done since PdV is nonzero, and so heat is leaked. This means that dQ is nonzero, and so energy is gotten rid of. Basically you have a gas going from a small medium and expanding into a larger container, but also gaining mols. You can find the work in this transition by knowing the initial and final states of the gas and integrating work along a reversible path (reversible cause easier to calculate). 
1446515731.92	7	0.0	Entropy change is basically the heating of the system. When a system has positive dQ, heat flows into it, and it increases in energy / e---entropy. If dQ is positive and -PdV is negative, then the system still gains energy, even if it does work on teh outside environment, which is intere--- The system's energy didn't change, but it did work on the environment. I'm not really sure how this works. I'm not sure this is the kind of studying I hsould do- I should read AFAP, then start on teh HW, where the real learning happens.

1446163149.68	0	3.0	heat is a bad state variable since it doesn't describe the system properly. A hot system contracting a little bit has the same heat change as a cool system contracting a lot. However, dQ/T is a good state var, since it takes out the heat-dependence.
1446165079.03	5	3.0	For reversible (no energy loss) processes, entropy is the same. dQ/T is the actual state variable, not entropy. So for irreversible processes, dQ/T is the state variable, and the actual dS can be larger.

1446246095.41	5	0.0	There are various ways to calculate entropy change. Entropy change has statistical meaning, bt it is also just another state function of a system: the number of ways it could exist in the current state. This is interesting. In statistical mechanics, S = Kbln(W), where W is the number of microstates in the current macrostate. It is weird that this uniquely defines a system. I'm actually really confused by that. It doesn't necessarly "define" the system, more like...for energy, transitions between two states change energy the same amount. ENergy doesn't necessarily define the system, but changes in energy define paths. Similarly, a change in entropy uniquely defines what paths a system can take. It can change its volume then pressure, or vice versa.
1446246965.91	5	0.0	You can calculate entropy change by exploiting that at constant pressure or volume, heat is just given by the heat capacity times change in temperature. This is because EHEat and Enthalpy are the same thing at constant pressure, and so Enthalpy over T is the change in entropy.
1446248246.2	5	0.0	At constant P, enthalpy change is entropy change times T.  For a phase change, the enthalpy of that phase change is the enthalpy change of the system when that change occurs, or the heat change at constant pressure. You can use this to figure out how entropy changes, since at constant pressure the change in heat can be used to figure out entropy.
1446248992.54	5	0.0	If ideal gas, then internal energy is given by temp. At constant temperature, you can use volume and pressure to determine entropy, since heat and work are the same thing.
1446249720.95	5	0.0	To solve for the change in entropy using T and P as variables, you break up the state transition into transitions along isothermal and isobaric transitions. The isobaric transition is just a heat change, and so Cp can be used to find the enthalpy change. For the isothermal change, you can use the fact that internal enetry is constant to solve for work and figure stuff out.

Forms to the right explin forms to the left. To the left is Charlie the Eagle. To the right of it is Eagle, then bird, then animal, etc.
1446454875.22	6	0.0	According to Plato we can only have opinions about the real world. We can create mental images through our imagination, which depend on the real things. We can then do science, which is hypothesizing forms for the things around us and the relationship of these forms to other forms. We are only hypothesizing forms here. We can then use dialectic, or reasoned argument and inspection, to figure out if our proposed Forms are real or not. Basically we can create things in the World of the Forms, then our minds, which exist there, can interact with these ideas and test whether they are correct or not.

1447021816.89	5	2.0	This chapter will be on relating new values togehter, like Gibbs Free Energy and Helmholtz free energy. Somehow Maxwell relations are used to create new relationships. A Maxwell relation is like what we saw with the mixed partials...taking derivatives of a function in different orders yields the same result.
1447022189.99	5	2.0	Natural Variables: Entropy, Volume and Molar Quanity. If you know the change in entropy, you know the change in heat. If you know the change in volume, you know the work done. If you know the change in molarity you know the chemical energy added. By integration you can figure the value of U anywhere.
1447022584.54	5	2.0	Didn't learn much, just noticed how the Maxwell relations work and how they liet you relate dthings together. That will likely be very useful for derivations and stuff. Also if you have constant T, P and ui, you can know the actual value of U by integrating over your entropy volume and molarity.
1447803845.97	5	2.0	Aristotle seeks to give a definition for what statements are. He is trying to define language, and what the "matter" of an argument is. This is really good and important, since being able to discuss rationality and truth and rightness mandates having a logical framework for how these things are conveyed. He basically starts out with "terms", which are individual objects - nouns adjectives adverbs. They are real things that identify stuff. In my system, they map to "concepts."
1447804666.38	5	2.0	A statement/sentence is a series of terms linked together. It can be True, False or Neither. "True" means that the concept linkage accurately maps to the outside world and could be verified somehow. The book is red is a true statement linking "book" and "red." In order for something to be true, it must be verifiable. "Love is good" is not a verifiable statement. "Marriage leads to happiness" is not exactly a verifiable statement, since it cannot be said to be true or not, since it is not measurable. If a particular marriage lead to happiness is also not verifiable, since it is too broad a concept - it is impossible to know how the person's life would have been otherwise. It is possible to verify wavelengths reflected from the outer layer of atoms on a book, but it is not possible to verify such broad claims as "happiness." While we can describe things as true, we have no way of verifying them and so they aren't True. Similarly False means that a statement can be verified to be true. Every False statement can be converted into a True statement via negation, so Falseness is kind of a specific type of Truth. Statements which are not meant to map to the outside world, such as requests, don't have Truth. Most statements are not meant to be truths, they are things we evolved to do to maximize survival. Conveying Truth is just one of the many purposes of verbal communication.
1447805434.97	5	2.0	Aristotle rejects the forms, he doesnt' believe reality is a shadow of another thing. He believes the ultimate reality of an object is its identity, its primary substance, its form (not Form).

1447964232.63	5	0.4	The sn naming scheme basically labels things as Pro-S or Pro-R depending on how them-having-a-group influences the overall designation of the molecule. The Pro-S carbon getting the group in question makes the molecule S. For purposes of naming triglycerides we are going to discuss sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, where sn means C1 IS the Pro-S carbon.
1447964763.69	5	0.2	Typically in a phosphotriglyceride the R1 is the most saturated, the R2 is unsaturated and R3 can be more polar, since R1 and 2 are inside the bilayer and R3 is off interacting with water. Being saturated makes R1 the best at packing together with a high melting point.

1447968742.01	5	0.3	Fluid mosaic model: Not really sure, I think it's just the accepted iew of the cellular membrane: a lipid bilayer that is a two-dimensional liquid which is free to move around and stuff. Also there is a melting point at which the layer stops being a solid, rigid thing and becomes more "liquid," where the bonds are broken between the lipids because they are so hot. Cholesterol broadens the melting point, since cholesterol somehow stabilies the lipids.
1447971016.44	5	0.3	Cholesterol stabilizes liquids and destabilizes solid membranes, blurring the line between solid & liquid. Also apparently fatty acids pass through membranes much quicker than triglycerides because they are nonpolar.
1447972725.45	5	0.2	Hydrophobic regions are usually alpha helices or beta barrels. There are peripheral membrane proteins, whcih are easily removed via inoic strength changes (ie are bonded ionically), and the integral proteins, which are things like the anion channel and other stuff. They are important and do functions and are embedded in the membrane, so they don't come off as easily? Detergents can get rid of them somehow, by bonding mre favorably to them than membarnes?

1447976946.48	5	0.1	The SecY protein is responsible for helping proteins fold within the lipid bilayer, as many apparently do. It is imporant to get them in the right orientation. It seems like proteins are secreted from teh ribosome into the transolocon (SecY/61). The translocon is hydrophilic-ish, and has particularly hydrophilic regions which the charged amino acids (arginine leucine histidine@lowph aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine) bond to. The molecule then diffuses out of teh translocon and into the lipid bilayer, or at least the hydrophobic part does.
1447977833.32	5	0.3	It is believed that the positivity of the cytoplasm directs the negative amino acids of a primary structure to face inwards, whereas the positive amino acids (histidine until 6, lysine until 9, arginine until 12) go outside, because the negative AAs go inside (aspartic and glutamic acids after pH 3,4.4)
1447978951.78	0	4.0	0
1447980542.56	0	0.1	There's roughly net zero force on proteins in the lipid bilayer. Head groups and slkyl chains apply pressure (entropic or enthalpic) to the proteins. Also there is interfactial pressure for some reason? This balances out the pushing of the things. Maybe the heads want to get away from the lipids so they repel...I really don't know. Also the pressure of the cell membrane can change. Like if the cell is high ionic strength and put in low ionic strength media, so water rushes in and would burst the cell. Except as cell expands curvature changes and causes proteins to oepn up (MscL) which allow water to leave cell.

It can live in the lipid bilayer since it's hydrophilically coated with glycines and valines and stuff. IDK how it gets stuff to leave it, though. Maybe that just happens randomly.
1447984086.05	0	2.0	Permeases couple favorable and unfavorable things. They can be open to the outside or inside, but never both. They don't need ATP to change conformation, this happens randomly? And basically somehow they shove stuff out by getting rid of more stuff that isn't liked than is liked.
