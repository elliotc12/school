1437950034.43	7	2.0	Read about file descriptor duplication and copy-on-write behavior of the fork() command.
1438025542.97	10	1.5	Learned about pipes, which are bytestreams. A bytestream is a type of file where there is no lseeking possible. You can only read in blocks, then read in the next block, etc. Pipes are unidirectional. If you close the write end of a pipe, you write an EOF before you close it for the reader to read.
1438026334.98	10	0.3	You can write under PIPE_BUF characters to a pipe and it is guaranteed to be atomic (not sure how...so the processor knows not to preempt the process and all interrupts are blocked when an atomic process is running? How is that guaranteed? If you write more than PIPE_BUF characters, it is not guaranteed to be an atomic write.
1438026989.74	10	1.5	Learned about how to create pipes and how the two fds of a process are dup'd on a call to fork().
1438027835.03	10	2.0	Learned the reason for forked processes to delete their unused pipe fds: the kernel doesn't have pipes behave normally if you don't. If there is still an unused write fd when reading, no EOF cwill be printed when the real writer closes. THis is a problem.
1438028505.57	10	2.0	Learned how pipes can be used to synchronize processes. Read reads in the amount of bytes you tell it, and blocks until it has read that amount. Write blocks until there is room to write. Reading moves the lseek buffer forward (metaphorically), thusly "deleting" the data behind it that has already been read.
1438029156.2	10	1.2	Didn't learn a lot.
1438029879.11	10	1.5	Started learning about FIFOs and the magic that they can do. FIFOs are basically pipes, but they are actual files, not stored in memory somewhere. FIFOs can be used to do interesting things, which I"ll learn abou tin a second.
1438030570.86	10	3.0	FIFOs can be used for lots of stuff. The tee command branches its input to both stdout AND a FIFO. pThreads is the mname of threads in Linux. ALl threads share the same heap (place where pointers are allocated), same globals, etc.
1438031457.58	5	1.4	Learned about how threads work. Threads all share the heap and environmental and global variables. They each get their own stack in program memory. They all read from the same program text, and presumably have their own program counter. Threads have an advantage over child processes in that they are faster to create and easier to synchronize. I will not learn about that synchronization.
1438031827.4	5	1.0	I learned about how threads in a single process share lots of stuff, like process ID, file descriptors, etc. They have separate thread IDs, signal blocking masks, stacks, scheduling information.

1438111198.87	5	0.3	Interrupted this time.
1438111536.06	5	1.0	I learned about how even the increment operator isn't necessarily atomic. In order to guarentee atomicity, use mutexes!
1438111915.73	5	1.0	Learned how mutexes work. If you try to lock a locked mutex, you start blocking (immediately leave the processor) and try again later. I think it's best to immediately lock and unlock the mutex when you are using a shared resource, so as to minimize the time you are blocking others on the processor.
1438112286.91	5	1.0	Learned how to make a mutex: just declare a variable of type pthread_mutex_t and a mutex will be statically allocated on the stack. Then use pthread_mutex_(un)lock to lock/unlock it.
1438112712.52	5	1.5	Learned about the alternatives to pthread_lock, trylock and timedlock. trylock is good because you can do other stuff instead of blocking, but it is bad because you can get starved pretty easily. timedlock is good, but good programs shouldn't have long lock times anyway, so timedlock shouldn't be necessary.
1438279744.4	5	1.0	Semaphores are like mutexes except can take on several values and can be used when there are multiple instances of some shared resource. They exist in the kernel, not userspace. Semaphores can be named or unnamed.
1438280079.52	5	1.3	Learned how to make semaphores (they are kind of like files) using sem_open.
1438280401.05	5	0.7	Learned about how to use semaphores a bit more.
1438280750.9	5	2.0	Learned how to use semaphores. Use sem_wait when you want to use a resource. When the function returns, you are free to use it. sem_wait will decrement the semaphore, or block if it is zero. sem_pos is used when you are done, to increment the semaphore. 
1438281081.37	5	2.0	Didn't really learn much. Read about how to get the value of a semaphore.
1438281463.03	5	0.3	Semaphores are different form mutexes in that mutexes have ownership: if a thread locks a mutex, somehow the locker of that mutex (its thread id) is stored in the mutex such that only that mutex can unlock it. This is not the case for semaphores. Therefore semaphores are uglier. Also, there is a thing called "async safety" that semaphores have. Not sure what that means.

1440431152.13	5	3.0	Reinforced that a prior is a probability of an event occuring, and when you get new information, these probabilities slide based on the new information. How likely an event is to occur is influenced by this new information, so you must factor it in.
1440431549.72	5	3.0	Learned the term "brainware" - components of the brain. Cool word, since it is similar to hardware. "Intuitive explanation" = concept easily portable to brainware constructs. Quantities are easily visualized in spcacial parts of the brain.
1440440981.53	5	0.0	
1441840875.66	7	7.0	Learned about how libertarianism is more harmonious thann other political philosophies, like the Republican party (conglomerate of Christians, gun-lovers and libertarian-ish ppl) and Democrats (conglomerate of sprogress-loving SJWs, socialists and people who want to maximize human hapiness).
1441841362.01	7	8.0	Read about how theory isn't always good, and even if llaissez-faire economics works in theory, that may not be how it actually works irl.

1443379387.67	7	3.0	Learned about proportionality of P,V and T for closed system and gained more intuition on what pressure actually is.
1443381146.9	7	3.0	Learned PV=nRT, kelvin scale defined in terms of triple point of water, and how the relationship is only experimentally true when P=0. Presumably there are more terms that need to be added to make it a true relation at higher pressures.
1443381930.99	7	2.0	Learned how to calculate pressure using force: just multiply gravity times mass to get gravitational force, and know that P/A is the upwards pressure force (pressure is exerted in all directions, unless there is a vacuum involved).
1443382543.45	7	4.0	Partial pressures are just pressures due to different species.
1443385850.38	7	3.0	Learned about how the Virial equation is a better equation of state and how partial pressure works.
1443386744.38	7	3.0	Learned about PVT surfaces. THey show relationships between phases of water.

1443388515.16	7	4.0	Modified Ideal Gas Law.
1443389164.19	7	4.0	Learned how Maclaurin series work! I wish I had known that a year ago, they are cool...

1443910419.6	5	0.0	Learned about the Maxwell construction and how dv/dP>0 is unstable. So VDW is not accurate in the LG region.
1443925607.57	5	5.0	Thales believes that everything is water and made of gods. Water since water has lots of phases, and gods since everything is made of immortal objects. Aristotle called him the First PHilosopher.
1443925982.05	5	7.0	Anaximander's argument was that, since everything that begins is started by something else, there must be something with no beginning that created everything else, since something cannot come from nothing.
1443926410.23	5	8.0	Anaximander explains how a primal boundless chaos gives rise to all the things around us by physical processes we see (things separating when spun). He is using things we see in real life to explain stuff, which makes him at least semi-empirical.
1443926819.41	5	6.0	Xenophanes, younger than Aximander and Thales, believes that the Gods/divine shouldn't be represented as Homer and Hesios represented them, as flawed yet powerful individuals. He believes the divine should be greater than that. So it seems like the greek gods weren't actually that popular or worshipped. Even back then, there was a desire for a strong, immortal, far-removed-from-humanity sort of Divine.

1444250006.83	5	0.0	dU = Q - W is just conservation of energy. It can be transformed into other stuff later.
1444250426.51	5	0.0	PV=nRT isn't always true? It seems like in a bomb calorimeter experiment it doesn't work that way...
1444255333.24	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the heat given off at constant temperature. When you want to know heat, you can use the dU = dQ + pdV + vdP definition. At constant pressure (eg in the body), dU = dQ - pdV, or dQ = dU + pdV. For convenience we define H = U + PV, so that dH = dH + PdV at constant pressure. Then we have another word for heat at constant pressure: enthalpy. Basically just remember that heat and enthalpy are the same thing in bodily systems.
1444262842.13	5	0.0	Enthalpy is the energy available to the system. dH = dU + PdV (at const pressure). This means that if combusting some sugar gives off 10 kJ (dU=-10e3J) and the expansion is by 1 m^3 at 1Pa, then dH = -10000J + 1J = -9999J. This means that 9999 joules are liberated for work by the act of sugar burning.
1444352043.58	5	0.0	Gibbs free energy measures statistical likelihood of a rxn happening. Gibbs can be calculated from standard gibbs, which is somehow calculated... mathematically? Not sure how the entropy term is solved for. Standard GFE is found for 1 molar substances, then an RTln(concentration) term fixes the value for any molarity. The total change for all involved molecules of gibbs free enrgy is the change in GFE for a particular rxn. The standard free energy is the free energy of a rxn of one molar substance. When the ---
1444589288.73	5	0.5	Learned how redox reacitons are similar to acid reactions. A molecule can give up an H+, or it can give up an e-, becoming a different molecule. In acid chemistry, there is a pKa that describes the equilibrium of this reaciton. NOt sure yet how it's done with redox reactions, but I'll find out!
1444590861.19	5	1.0	Volts, or the difference in coloumbic field between two points, is the difference in potential energy between two points. If a particle transitions from a high-voltage area to a low-voltage area, they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, depending on their charge. This is path-independent, since potential energy is s tate function that only cares about starting and ending state. AAlso learned about  E0. E0 is the energy given off when an electron reduces the oxidant into the reductant in a particular pairing. E0 is kind of the negative voltage difference between the reductant and oxidant.
1444591301.61	5	1.0	High E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a strong oxidizer and its reductant is a weak oxidizer. Conversely, low E0 implies the rxn's oxidant is a weak oxidant, whereas the reductant is a strong oxidant. E0 is basically how good the oxidant is at being an oxidant.
1444591825.44	5	0.0	The above statement is wrong! High E0 implies that the rexn happens a lot. That means that the oxidant is good at oxidizing, so it does, turning into the reductant. If the reductant was good at reducing, then it would, and go back into the oxidant and the rxn wouldn't be forward-biased. A high E0 actually means that the oxidant is a good oxidizer and the reductant is a bad reducer, it doesn't want to give up the electron it has gained. A low E0 means that the rxn doesn't happen a lot, meaning the electron-poor form is bad at gaining electrons (oxidizing) and the electron-rich form is good at giving them up (reducing). High E0: good oxidizer bad reducer. Low E0: bad oxidizer good reducer. Pair a good reducer with a good oxidier and you have a very spontaneous process!
1444592306.17	5	1.0	NADH is a good reducer. It gives off two electrons and a proton (gives off -2 and +1, ie gains 1) becoming NAD+. It is used for a lot of biological stuff whenever the body needs to reduce something. Also the delta G for a rxn is proportional to Ebig - Esmall, the net energy given off in the rxn, times -nF, where n is the # of electrons given off and F is a constant proportional to energy per mol per volt).
1444593171.77	5	0.0	E0 can also be thought of as the "negative voltage of the spot where teh electron goes in a rxn. A free electron has 0 PE, and when it encounters O2, it gains 8.15 J/mol/C in KE. It also takes 8.15 J/m/c to remove the electron from the reduced form.
1444593644.35	5	1.0	ethanol is spontaneously converted to acetaldehyde, 2H and 2e- in the cell, since its E0 is negative.

1444594468.89	5	0.0	For some reason you use the gas pressure relative to normal gas pressure, not the absolute gas molarity, to determine the concentration for use in Henderson-Hasselbach type calculatesion.
1444595104.35	5	1.0	You never multiply E0 by anything. E0 is just the energy per erelectron. It's not like you're going to have double the energy per electron if you use twice as much NADH to reduce O2 into H20.
1444606109.11	5	4.0	Just reviewing basic physics of forces, work, etc.
1444606687.26	5	7.0	Still not much!
1444607250.85	5	3.0	Work is path-dependent, yyou can pressurize and work against lots of pressure, or work against low pressure then pressurize, and reach the same state of pressurized higher volume but different work. 
1444607570.08	5	3.0	Adiabatic systems are those that are heat-isolated, not constant temperature.

1446418644.81	5	0.0	Plato discusses mathematics as knowledge. He says that it is possible to completely grasp the "reason" why mathematics works, and therefore our knowledge of math is knowledge, not belief. The example given was you can "know" (not believe) that a square composed of the diagonal of an existing square in side length is double the area of the existing square. This proof can be seen, and the proof is simple enough to cosntitute a complete, undeniable reason. I disagree. The "reason" is not a reason. It seems like it could be true, but is it? It could be a false proof that just looks really true, but isn't always true in all cases, or something like that. Math is a theoretical set of axioms that can be interpreted by the mind. Operations can be done in the mind. But it is possible to create proofs that look right but aren't right, or rather, that don't agree with the other axioms. 
1446419551.89	5	0.0	Plato believes that if something really really makes sense, it is a "reason" which is somehow not just a concept in his mind but linked to universal truth. He believes that seeing a picture of a square with a small diagonal square inside it, and seeing that each piece of small square has a mirrored piece outside the small square but in the large square proves that the large square is exactly double the small square's area. He believes that this explanation of a conceptual thing is Truth. In reality, this is just semantics. It is using pattern matching to relate phrases together. The proof can be expressed verbally using symbols, and the mind can see if all the small phrases are true, and if they are all true, the chain must be true and the claim and the solution must have a chain of implication. But this isn't truth, this is just creating sentences that seem to agree. But they say fundamentally different things, and so can't have any meaning. Implication doesn't exist, there is nothing but sensory experience. Math isn't a special thing that exists outside of us, math that can be interpreted by human beings is a set of things that our brain creates that relate. There is no such thing as rationality ahhhhhh this is way too much and I have no means of evaluating what is right or wrong I am just generating sentences that don't make sense what is sense sense is patterns that seem to relate well you can never escape the brain's world everything you think or do is governed by the brain you must understand how the brain works in order to understand reality ahhhhh
1446421937.58	5	0.0	Math is trivially true. It is a logical framework, and so it can make statements and those statements can either agree or disagree with the rest of the framework. It is "true" in the sense that it is consistent, but can we really know? Can we really meaningfully interact with mathland and determine whether things are true? Our brains are physical objects rmine whether statements are true? No. Our brain is a physical object which takes stimuli and has neurons change states to produce an output. If a computer program could perfectly simulate the neural network of a human brain, with all the connections, the type of each connection, the way neurotransmitters influence the behavior if individual neurons, and how the neurons interact with other objects in the brain (glia), it would be possible to tell the computer about the square problem and it would change its state. You would then ask it whether this statement was true, it would change state some more and return the answer true to you. But do you really think that something magical happened in this system? The neural network changed state to bring the problem inside it, then did pattern matching, drew upon memories, displayed the problem different ways, then gradually increased the number of neurons innervating the "say yes" region, which then said yes to you. Nothing in this process tells us that Truth was acquired. We just saw a physical process occur, like a billiar ball crash into a big network of other billiard balls. We don't ascribe Truth or Knowledge to the physical process any more than we ascribe truth to billiard balls flying around. Physical processes cannot contain truth, since they are just atoms. These atoms can be moved around in a way tha--- takes the outside world and represents it internally, but this mapping is imperfect. And since the mapping is imperfect, the very best we could hope to get is how something happens in the internal mapping of the brain, but not how something happens in the external world. And this is a best case scenario. In reality, the internal conception of reality in a human brain is not simulated at all. A network of concepts is created and reacted to, but no simulation ofthe world occurs. If a human is asked to take a physical system that really occurs in the world, say a ball that is falling, and extrapolate what will happen next, the human will look at the ball. It will note that the problem is a ball is falling. It will have a picture of a ball, and it will draw on its memories of what it has experienced in the past in regards to falling balls: they fall. It will draw upon its physics knowledge, that a ball is moving with some velocity and that it will keep moving unless acted on by a force. It will draw upon its basic pattern-matching system, which tells it that this is a dumb question that is asked to many people and the answer is always "it falls". So the human will say the phrase "it will keep falling down" and that will be that. This claim has nothing to do with reality, it is a claim constructed from memories and observations. There is no reason to think it is right, even if all the information in the world was at the grips of this human. This human is just a system of interconnected neurons. Nowhere in the human is a falling ball, the falling ball is outside. There is no reason to think the human's brain will do the same thing the falling ball will, since the falling ball is outside, and the human is not the falling ball. We have two different systems. They are connected, but are fundamentally different. The human brain is just a collection of neurons, and by its nature, cannot be anything other than that: a collection of atoms. There is no Truth in the human brain, only atoms. 
1446423009.53	5	0.0	There is no machine which interacts with Truth in the brain, the brain takes in sensory information and runs basic processes on itself and comes to a conclusion that helps it stay alive. Pl--- The square which Plato is referring to isn't a real square in teh world. It isn't a Timeless Mathematical Object, either. It is a group of neurons which interpret words on a page, take the picture of a square with a square inside its diagonals, make the claim that because the inside of the square is exactly mirrored by the non-inside square the two must be equal, then innervate speech neurons to say so. This object doesn't exist, it is always bound in neurons and can be put in other brains by speech or writing, but it doesn't exist in the physical world. But it can be put in brains, and these brains can then use it to do physical work. So it is useful and good. Its a special pattern that happens to make good things. The pattern can exist in neural linkages, in electrons being pushed from one place to another, in teh form of sound vibrations or scribbles on a page. And it influences other brains. But it does not exist. It can never be truly evaluated, since that word has no real definition. It can only be interpreted by the brain and used to trigger statements that can be heard by others. Ideas exist in the brain and can be transmitted to others. They are represented by matter, and can interact with other ideas in the brain. But they can never reach the truth, since they will always be patterns in matter.

1445110292.66	5	0.0	DNA discovered by Frederich Miecher in 1870, surgical dressings. DNA is RNA with an H instead of an OH on its 2' carbon. 5' goes to the O of a Phosphate, 3' goes to the O of a phosphate, 1' goes to base. Bases either double bond or triple bond (H bonds) to other bases.
1445119138.71	5	0.0	DNA primary structure: ATGCTGAAA. DNA secondary structure: the way a single helix is formed. The bond lengths of the complementary bases in a helix. Tertiary Structure: the way different helices interact. Not sure if secondary or tertiary: supercoiling and the structures this creates. Probably secondary structure?
1445124321.75	5	1.0	Learned that the hydrolysis of polynucleotides is favored, but incredibly slow kinetically. This makes it "metastable."
1445125608.65	5	1.0	To make a DNA polymer you start with a nucleoside triphosphate. You add it to a polymer. The 3' OH on the polymer attacks the triphosphate and a diphosphate leaves. The diphosphate is a much better leaving group than an OH, which is why attack on a triphosphate is favorable when attack on a monophosphate is not favorable.
1445127141.94	5	0.0	Diphosphate is easier to remove from a Pi than OH, and so that is why ATP must be added to a polynucleotide, not AMP.
1445127903.51	5	1.0	Pyramidines pair with purines...Adenine and Guanine are purines, thymine and cytosine are pyramidines. AT and GC bond.
1445129018.56	5	1.0	Conservative: DNA is conserved, initial and final template is the same. Semi-conserved: part of the final template is the same as the initial template. Noncoblah Dispersive: new template has atoms of old template, not in order though.
1445131897.16	5	0.0	A form: RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA, low-humidity DNA-DNA. B form: DNA-DNA high humidity, ie, cellular conditions. A form more tightly packed, 11 residues per turn. B form less tightly packed, 10 per turn.
1445132322.94	5	0.0	B-DNA is more stable than A at high humidity, but A more stable at low humidity. B stabilized by water in its minor groove (?) at high humidity.
1445133208.81	5	0.0	Supercoiling: negative left-hand. supercoiling is tertiary structure of polynucleotide. Relaxed molecules float around and have longness. Super/supracoiled stuff doesn't do this.
1445139805.43	5	3.0	Polynucleotides rich in CG bonds have a higher dH for denaturing, since CG bonds are stronger. A molecule with all AT bonds would be much easier to break than one with all CG bonds.

1445827401.49	6	2.0	AAs are chiral - there is a D and an----- Also an RS form, think D and L are used more though. In a Fischer projection the H and R groups are opposite, and the amine and carboxyl groups are opposite too.
1445829969.71	6	0.0	You can predict where stuff'll cleave. R1 means it cleaves to the right, R2 means it cleaves to the left. Cysteine forms disulfide bonds with other cysteines, and so cannot react with certain things.
1445831039.11	6	3.0	Proline is a cyclic amino acid, and has an NH2 group. This means it's pretty stable and won't give up any Hs at 10 pH. probably. Also cysteine forms disulfide bonds when it gets oxidized. A good oxidizer like O2 would come in and take electrons from two SH groups, so they couldn't support their Hs. They would then bond together.
1445967122.89	7	1.0	no
1445967789.47	7	1.0	Learned that I should only read stuff I find interesting so I can get on with other work. Also that an LMM (Euler's method, backwards Euler's method, Trapezoidal method, not sure about RUnge-kutta etc) is a method which relates positions with the derivative of those positions and times (NO squaring, fancy stuff involved).
1445968270.76	7	2.0	Learning how the Adam-Bashforth method works. Euler's works by relating the current derivative and position to finding the next point. AB works by relating the current AND next derivative AND next position to finding the next next position. Not really sure why the previous derivative has any information useful for finding the next next position.
1445969686.64	7	7.0	Stiff DEs: Those that are hard to numerically compute because they have very steep velocities and thusly can be hard to track. A spline is a piecewise polynomial fit to a certain function. Runge's phenomenon: The higher the order of a polynomial fit, the more inter-node error there will be. 
1445970204.59	7	2.0	Trapezoidal method is the highest-order error-term method, for some weird reason. NOt sure why. There are many LMM methods and they all take into account many different derivatives, but they are all just linear combinations of these different terms. I think RK and other methods are more sophisticated.
1445970781.24	7	3.0	Stiff DE: one that varies lots. Something about their matrix representation idicates that they are stiff. Convergence: Whether the approximate solution approaches the real solution as h->0. If the order (thhe order of h in the error term) in the order is greater than 0, then the solution is stable since the error goes to zero quicker (or as quicly as) the timestep.
1445988045.76	7	3.0	You can use polynomial interpolation (fitting to what?) to find the alpha/beta terms in the linear combination of position vs velocity fequality.
1445989590.05	7	3.0	Figured out kind of how to come up with the values for polynomials in an LMM, although it's preeeetty complicated. You do polynomial fitting to find the polynomial that best matches how good your particular i really don't know...
