  notes={This paper uses a simple automata model with uniform random weights to show how inhibitory neurons influence the system. It does the same method described in -entropyinhibition- of modeling the system as a random walk and calculating the "branching ratio" as a function of current activity, where br > 1 indicates growing activity. It uses the steady-state version of the model to show that, for inhibitory systems, for low activity br > 1 and high activity br < 1, leading to a stable system with 'ceaseless activity.'}

They claim that the Nieber avalanches are created by a "neutral" process where activity is equally likely to continue or disperse. This defends the idea that brains are still "critical" avalanches.},
  questions={1. How are critical avalanches with bp=1 not neutral? How is 50/50 for the avalanche to continue different than 50/50 that a neuron will cause its neigbor to fire? 2. Why are time-binned avalanches special, why is showing that a neutral process generates causal avalanches a way of discarding it?}

  notes={A paper which uses an automata network model with inhibitory and excitatory weights. The paper uses a mean-field-esque technique to simplify the network into a random walk, then calculates the master random walk equation to find the steady-state behavior of excitation (fraction of nodes excited). They use this steady-state distribution to find the effect of connection strength and exc/inh fraction on entropy and entropy parameter-stability. They find that entropy is maximized between the down and up states, and whats more, find that robust entropy is found for very low inhibition-to-excitation ratios. They claim that high entropy is good for maximizing the repertoire of available states, but could hurt signal-to-noise.},

  pages={857-860},
  year={2007},

  notes={This paper discusses how average synapse weight is important for criticality, and how changing average synapse weight can control whether criticality is seen or not. They use a dynamical model and show that being dynamic isn't actually important, as long as the average synaptic weight is correct for criticality. However, dynamic synapses provide a much larger "margin of error" for being semi-critical, indicating they may be self-organizing.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  year={2015},
  publisher={PLOS},
  notes={This paper uses a complex biological LIF model with leak, synaptic conductances for GABA and Glutamatergic channels, and both STP and EI-STDP. It achieves both criticality and balance, where E and I currents generally balance each other. It achieves pretty intense stability: injecting a single spike only adds ~20 resultant spikes; more dramatic stimulation "perturbes" the system lightly, but it returns to its stable state. The network changes its excitatory values on purturbation to values different than they were initially at, indicating that the system may have an infinite number of fixed points it can relax at. The network also achieves what they call "persistent asynchronous background activity," which basically means high-Fanno-Factor firing without input. This is a really cool paper which would be a good one to emulate, since their network seems like it has potential for some really cool dynamics.},

  notes={Describes the idea of "omitted stimulus potential" where when a network is driven with a rhythmic stimulus, on termination of the stimulus the network still mimics the would-be response. This is believed to be a result of STDP within the network "encoding" the driving stimulus. Uses a Gaussian distribution to assign each neuron's biophysical parameters, and shows that heterogeneous networks are capable of generating important "nonperiodic synchrony" but homogenous-parameter networks fall into periodic states of network spiking. This seems very relevant for biophysical simulations. They also show that communities of neurons spontaneously form for different purposes during stimulation, for the purpose of replaying that stimulation. This is an emergent property of the network. They also use weights as a "synaptic resource" and show how network spikes deplete this network resource.},

  notes={This is the original coherence potentials paper. They find that CPs occur within 10ms of each other, and the full pre- and post-cp waveform extended for 100-200 ms. CPs propagate through cascades, with a decaying exponential probability for successive occurrences. Their FFTs indicate no dominant peaks. Though oscillations are present in the CP sequence, since the autocorrelation looks periodic. CPs only decay a little bit, 10 per cent, after ten steps. Propagation is distance independent. CPs are always strong activity of several SDs.},

  notes={Speculation paper that says that "coherence" between neural populations, ie not only frequency-matching but phase-matching, could be a way of passing information. When coherent, populations can reliably send information back-and-forth; when decoherent, populations can try to communicate when firing or in refractory period, disfacilitating communication. Some experimental evidence that this happens. Speculation that early-vision (layer 4 of V4) systems and late-vision systems can communicate by cohering.},

  notes={This paper finds coherence potentials in ECoG data from humans. Their grid is 64 cm^2, so pretty big. It spans multiple brain regions. Their most interesting finding is that some CPs occur for the whole multi-minute behavior period and can return after several-second quiet periods, indicating they don't need to overlap in time. They found that some CPs were strongly associated with certain behaviors and were biased towards electrodes which encoded those behaviors: the right hand digit electrode which moved the right hand digits when stimulated was a strong host for the RH CP, and was often the first to generate the CP within a behavior window. They found that CPs that were associated with analogous tasks, like right vs left hand movements, had similar CPs, though this was with small sample size. Some CPs were very predictive of a future behavior, with R>0.95.},
