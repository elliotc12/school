  notes={This paper uses a simple automata model with uniform random weights to show how inhibitory neurons influence the system. It does the same method described in -entropyinhibition- of modeling the system as a random walk and calculating the "branching ratio" as a function of current activity, where br > 1 indicates growing activity. It uses the steady-state version of the model to show that, for inhibitory systems, for low activity br > 1 and high activity br < 1, leading to a stable system with 'ceaseless activity.'}

  notes={This paper responds to the non-critical avalanches found in the 2009 Martinelli/Nieber nature physics LIF paper. They claim that the Nieber avalanches are created by a "neutral" process where activity is equally likely to continue or disperse. This defends the idea that brains are still "critical" avalanches.},
  questions={1. How are critical avalanches with bp=1 not neutral? How is 50/50 for the avalanche to continue different than 50/50 that a neuron will cause its neigbor to fire? 2. Why are time-binned avalanches special, why is showing that a neutral process generates causal avalanches a way of discarding it?}

  notes={A paper which uses an automata network model with inhibitory and excitatory weights. The paper uses a mean-field-esque technique to simplify the network into a random walk, then calculates the master random walk equation to find the steady-state behavior of excitation (fraction of nodes excited). They use this steady-state distribution to find the effect of connection strength and exc/inh fraction on entropy and entropy parameter-stability. They find that entropy is maximized between the down and up states, and whats more, find that robust entropy is found for very low inhibition-to-excitation ratios. They claim that high entropy is good for maximizing the repertoire of available states, but could hurt signal-to-noise.},
